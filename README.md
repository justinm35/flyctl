flyctl is a Go-powered TUI for exploring flight availability from the terminal. It provides a fast, keyboard-driven interface for searching routes, viewing aggregated results, and inspecting segment-level details (carriers, layovers, times, duration, and pricing). Built using Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, and Charm’s TUI ecosystem.
